\f0\fs28 \cf0 In this project. a reimplementation of the NMMSO algorithm in R was shown. As part of this project also, a reimplementation of the CEC Benchmarking Suite was created. It was shown that it is possible to translate a Matlab program into R while keeping the comparability at a high level. In the programming project approaches have been shown and tested to overcome common differences in the two programming language to implement an existing algorithm in both languages. \
\
Even though this implementation is not the most performant and certainly had its problems while being implemented, a recreation of the NMMSO algorithm and the CEC benchmarking tool have been done which work reliably and provide similar results to the original implementations. \
\
A foundation to further use this both packages has been set, which enables further testing and invite to reuse the nmmso.R for different uses. Especially an improvement in the implementations performance could be interesting. In this matter it could already help to minimize the I/O actions, which are currently done to gather the benchmarking data. But also other improvements to better match the style of R could help.}

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>In the recent years, R has become the statistical programming language of choice for many scientists. The strength of R, being a domain specific language, has also become one of its weaknesses. Since new research findings in statistical computing are split up over several languages like R, Matlab or SciPy[^1], it often becomes difficult to compare new methods with established ones. Because it is also hard to interface those languages due to different architectures and data storage mechanisms the...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>General Function</strong><br/>The starting point of the project was the paper provided by Dr. Jonathan E. Fieldsend [@fieldsend_2014] on the Niching Migratory Multi-Swarm Optimiser (NMMSO) algorithm. NMMSO is a multi-modal optimiser which relies heavily on multiple swarms that are generated on the landscape of a function in order to find the global optima. It is build around three main pillars: <br/>
(1) dynamic in the numbers of dimensions, <br/>
(2) self-adaptive without any special preparation and <br/>
(3) exploitative local search to ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>CEC</strong><br/>The IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC) is one of the largest, most important and recognized conferences within Evolutionary Computation (EC). It is organised by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society in cooperation with the Evolutionary Programming Society and covers most of the subtopics of the EC.<br/>
<br/>
In order to validate the potential of the NMMSO algorithm, it was submitted to the IEEE CEC 2015 held in Sendai, Japan. Here, Dr. Fieldsend was provided with some multimodal benchm...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Implementation and Pitfalls</strong><br/>During the developing time, an issue raised with the CEC benchmark tool. In order to compare the R implementation of the NMMSO algorithm with the original one, it was mandatory to use this tool to test each of its functions with the new algorithm and compare results. After several complications with the original test suite (these complications will be addressed in the pitfalls’ section), it was decided to recode each of the functions as an independent R package to avoid any further complication ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Structure of the project</strong><br/>In difference to the original implementation it was chosen to split up all single functions of the nmmso algorithm into single files. These were bundled into the standard R package structure to give the possibility to make it available over CRAN[^2] in the future. To and give the possibilty to collaborate the project was managed and versioned via Github. The package was tested with testthat[^3] and documented with roxygen2[^4]. To assure functioning the package was continuously tested with Travi...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Pitfalls and Problems</strong><br/>In the beginning of the project, after translating each function into the R programming language and in order to start testing each one of them, some data was missing. The algorithm runs with some parameters that had to be given by the CEC so it was necessary to contact the organisation and ask for the files including the benchmarking tool. Also, Dr. Fieldsend was contacted in order to have a better understanding of the general structure of his algorithm. Once the data was completed, the test ph...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Benchmark and Comparison</strong><br/><br/>
To compare nmmso.R with the original NMMSO the CEC test cases were used to run the same benchmarks as in the original submission [@fieldsend_2014]. There 4 different Ratios were used to measure the performance of certain algorithms. Three of those measures (Peak Ratio, Success Ratio and Convergence Speed) have been introduced in [@epitropakis_2013, pp. 6-7] to create a common point of comparison. The fourth ratio is special for the nmmso algorithm since it tracks the number of swarms over the i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Conclusion</strong><br/>In this project a reimplementation of the NMMSO algorithm in R was shown. As part of this project also a reimplementation of the CEC Benchmarking Suite was created. It was shown that it is possible to translate a Matlab program into R </p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br/>We want to thank Dr. Jonathan Fieldsend for his continuous help via mail during this seminar. Also, the committee of the CEC was always available for questions and concerns during our work. Furthermore, a special thanks go to all employees of the chair for 'Information Systems and Statistics' including Dr. Mike Preuß, Jakob Bossek and Pascal Kerschke who were available for any questions regarding the implementation and this report at all times.<br/>

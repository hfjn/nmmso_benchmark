<p class="binderItem"><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>In the recent years R has become the statistical programming language of choice for many scientist. The strength of R of being a domain specific language has also become one of its weaknesses. Since new research findings in statistical computing are split up over several languages like R, Matlab or SciPy[^1] it often becomes difficult to compare new methods with established ones. Since it is also hard to interface those languages due to different architectures, data storage mechanisms there is o...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>General Function</strong><br/>The starting point of the project was the paper provided by Dr. Jonathen E. Fieldsend [@fieldsend_2014] on the Niching Migratory Multi-Swarm Optimiser (NMMSO) algorithm. NMMSO is a multi-modal optimiser which relies heavily on multiple swarms which are generated on the landscape of an function in order to find the global optima. It is build around three main pillars: (1) dynamic in the numbers of dimensions, (2) self-adaptive without any special preparation and (3) exploitative local search to q...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>CEC</strong><br/>The IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC) is one of the largest, most important and recognised conferences within Evolutionary Computation (EC). It is organised by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society in cooperation with the Evolutionary Programming Society, and covers most of the subtopics of the EC.<br/>
<br/>
In order to validate the potential of the NMMSO algorithm, it was submitted to the IEEE CEC 2013 held in Cancun, Mexico. Here, Dr. Fieldsend was provided with some multimodal benc...</p>

#Pitfalls<br/>
<br/>
When the decision of re-writing the whole benchmark tool in the R programming language was taken, some issues came up regarding the way Matlab handles the matrices and vectors. After analysing the Matlab implementation, <br/>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Structure of the project</strong><br/>After analysing the algorithm provided in Matlab by Dr. Fieldsend, it was decided to first translate each of the functions into the R programming language. At first instance, this task seemed to be simple because most of the functions were basically managing matrices and vectors, but later this became a problem that will be addressed in the pitfalls’ section of this paper.<br/>
<br/>
Once all the NMMSO functions existed in R and having the input data, the testing phase started. It has be said, that one of...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Pitfalls and Problems</strong><br/>In the beginning of the project, after translating each function into the R programming language and in order to start testing each one of them, some data was missing. The algorithm runs with some parameters that had to be given by the CEC so it was necessary to contact the organisation and ask for the files including the benchmarking tool. Also, Dr. Fieldsend was contacted in order to have a better understanding of the general structure of his algorithm. Once the data was completed, the test ph...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Benchmark and Comparison</strong><br/><br/>
To compare nmmso.R with the original NMMSO the CEC test cases were used to run the same benchmarks as in the original submission [@fieldsend_2014]. There 4 different Ratios were used to measure the performance of certain algorithms. Three of those measures (Peak Ratio, Success Ratio and Convergence Speed) have been introduced in [@epitropakis_2013, pp. 6-7] to create a common point of comparison. The fourth ratio is special for the nmmso algorithm since it tracks the number of swarms over the i...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br/>We want to thank Dr. Jonathan Fieldsend for his continuous help via mail during this seminar. Also the committee of the CEC was always available for questions and concerns during our work. Furthermore a special thanks goes to all employees of the chair for 'Information Systems and Statistics' including Dr. Mike Preuß, Jakob Bossek and Pascal Kerschke who were available for any questions regarding the implementation and this report at all times.<br/>
